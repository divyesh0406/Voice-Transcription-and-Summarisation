text1 = """There are many techniques available to generate extractive summarization
to keep it simple, I will be using an unsupervised learning approach to
find the sentences similarity and rank them. Summarization can be
defined as a task of producing a concise and fluent summary while
preserving key information and overall meaning. One benefit of this will
be, you do not need to train and build a model prior start using it for
your project. It is good to understand Cosine similarity to make the best
use of the code you are going to see. Cosine similarity is a measure of
similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that
measures the cosine of the angle between them. Its measures cosine of
the angle between vectors. The angle will be 0 if sentences are similar."""
